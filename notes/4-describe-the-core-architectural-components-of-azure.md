## What is Microsoft Azure?

Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help you meet current and future business challenges.

### What does Azure offer?

Limitless innovation. Build intelligent apps and solutions with advanced technology, tools, and services to take your business to the next level.

  * Bring ideas to life. Build on a trusted platform to advance your organization with industry leading AI and cloud services.
  * Seamlessly unify. Efficiently manage all your infrastructure, data, analytics, and AI solutions across an integrated platform.
  * Innovate on trust. Rely on trusted technology from a partner who's dedicated to security and responsibility.

### What can I do with Azure?

Azure provides more than 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms, such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

For example, Azure provides artificial intelligence and machine-learning services that can naturally communicate with your users through vision, hearing and speech. 

It also provides storage solutions that dynamically grow to accomodate massive amounts of data.

Azure services enables solutions that aren't feasible without the power of the cloud.

## Get started with Azure accounts

To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription.

## Using the Learn sandbox

Another way to interact is with the Azure CLI interactive mode. This changes CLI behavior to more closely resemble an integrated development environment (IDE).

Interactive mode provides autocompletion, command descriptions, and even examples.

Enter az interactive to enter interactive mode.

```ps
az interactive
```

## Describe Azure physical infrastructure

### Physical infrastructure

The physical infrastructure for Azure starts with datacenters. Conceptually, datacenters are the same as large corporate datacenters. They're facilities with resources arranged in racks, with dedicated power, cooling and networking infrastructure.

As a global cloud provider, Azure has datacenters around the world. However, these individual datacenters aren't directly accessible.

Datacenters are grouped into Azure Regions or Azure Availability Zones that are designed to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads.

The Global Infrastructure site can be used to view the infrastructure: https://datacenters.microsoft.com/globe/explore

#### Regions

A region is a geographical area on the planted that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.

When you deploy a resource in Azure, you'll often need to choose the region where you want your resource to be deployed.


Some services or virtual machine (VM) features are only available in certain regions, such as specific VM sizes or storage types. 

There are also some global Azure services that don't require you to select a particular region, such as Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure DNS.

#### Availability zones

Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region.

Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling and networking. 

An availability zones is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. 

Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic cables.

To ensure resiliency, a minimum of three seperate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions. Not all Azure regions support availability zones.

##### Use availability zones in your app

You can use availability zones to run mission-critical applications and build high-availability into your application architecture by co-locating your compute, storage, networking, and data resources within an availability zone and replicating in other availability zones. There might be a cost involved!

Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases.

Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:

  * Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone (VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
  * Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones (zone-redundant storage, SQL database).
  * Non-regional services: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilitient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.

Even with the additional resiliency that availability zones provide, it's possible that an event could be so large that it impacts multiple availability zones in a single region. To provide further resiliency, Azure has Region Pairs.

#### Region Pairs

Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away.

Allows for replication of resources across a geography that reduces the likelihood interruptions in the case of events like natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect an entire region.

Not all Azure services automatically replicate data or automatically fall back from a failed region, in some scenarios this needs to be configured by the customer.

Advantages of regional pairs:
  * If an extensive Azure outage occurs, one region out of every pair is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quickly as possible for applications hosten in that region pair.
  * Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimize downtime and risk of appliation outage.
  * Data continues to reside within the same geograhpy as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax- and law-enforcement jurisdiction purpores.

Most regions have two-directional pairing. In the case of one-directional pairing, the primary region does not provide a back-up for the secondary region.

#### Sovereign regions

Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure. You may need to use a sovereign region for compliance and legal purposes.

Some sovereign regions are: US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa. These regions are physical and logical network isolated instances of Azure for the U.S. government agencies and partners.

China East, China West, and more: These regions are available through a partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft doesn't directly maintain the data centers.
