# Describe cloud service types

The chapter is about how each cloud service type determines the flexibility you'll have with managing and configuring resources.

## Describe infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is the most flexible category of cloud services, and it provides you with the maximum amount of control for your cloud services. 

The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet) and physical security. You are responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, maintenance, network configuration, database and storage configuration, and so on.

IaaS places that largest share of resposibility with you. You are responsible for installation and configuration, patching and updates, and security.

Common scenarios:
  * Lift-and-shift migrations: You're setting up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simply moving the things running on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure.
  * Testing and development: You have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate. You can start up or shut down the different environments rapidly with an IaaS structure, while maintaining complete control.

## Describe platform as a service (PaaS)

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service). In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security and connection to the internet.

Additionally, they also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. 

In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching of the operating systems and databases.

Common scenarios:
  * Development framework: PaaS provides a a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. Cloudes features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducting the amount of coding that developers must do.
  * Analytics or business intelligence: Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data, finding insights and patterns and predicting outcomes to improve forcasting, product design decisions, investment returns, and other business decisions.

## Describe software as a service (SaaS)

Software as a service (SaaS) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. With SaaS, you're essentially rending or using a fully developed application. Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation.

While the SaaS model may be the least flexible, it is also the easiest to get up and running. It requires the least amount of technological knowledge or expertise to fully employ.

Common scenarios:
  * Email and messaging.
  * Business productivity applications.
  * Finance and expense tracking.
