# Describe the benefits of using cloud services

## Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud

When you are deploying an application, a service, or any IT resources, it's important the resources are available when needed.

**High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability**, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.

### Scalability

Scalability refers to the ability to adjust the resources to meet demand. Scaling generally comes in two varieties: vertical and horizontal scaling.

#### Vertical scaling

Vertical scaling adds more CPUs or RAM to the system. It determines how much compute resources are dedicated to a single instance of a resource.

#### Horizontal scaling

Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources. If there is a sudden jump in demand, it is possible to scale out to more instances of a resource.

This can also be done automatically.

## Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud

### Reliability

**Reliability** is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. 

The cloud, by virtue of its decentralized design, naturally supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure. 

With a decentralized design, the cloud enabled you to have resources deployed in regions around the world. This this global scale, even if one region has a catastrophic event other regions are still up and running. You can design your application to automatically take advantage of this increases reliability.

### Predictability

**Predictability** in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on the **performance predictability** or **cost predictability**.

#### Performance

Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.

Autoscaling can deploy additional resources to meet demand, and scale back when demand drops.

If traffic is heavily focused in one area, load balancing will help redirect some of the overload to less stressed areas.

#### Cost

Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. 

## Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud

Cloud features support governance and compliance.

**Set templates** help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements. It is possible to update all your deployed resources to new standards as standards change.

**Cloud-based auditing** helps flag any resource that's out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides migration strategies.

Depending on your operation model, software patches and updates may happen automatically.

If you want maximum control of security, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provides you with physical resources but lets you manage the operating system and installed software, including patches and maintenance.

If you want patches and maintenance to be taken care of automatically, platform as a service (PaaS) or software as a service (SaaS) deployments may be the best cloud strategies for you.

Cloud providers are typically well suites to handle things like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

## Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud

Manageability for cloud computing can be divided into two types.

### Management of the cloud

Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:

  * Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
  * Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
  * Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
  * Recieve automatic alerts based on configured metric, so you're away of performance in real time.

### Management in the cloud

Management in the cloud speaks to how you're able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:

  * Through a web portal.
  * Using a command line interface.
  * Using APIs.
  * Using PowerShell.
